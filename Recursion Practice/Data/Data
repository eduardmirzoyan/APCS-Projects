Questions:
1. The timing data for Recursion increased as the input was made larger, but for the loop, the time was
	relatively the same. The loop data was also overall shorter. There was such a gap because the
	recursion method had to repeat itself much more times than the loop.
2. Both forms start out about the same but the recursions ramps up in its iterations much quickly while
	the loop seems to be more linearly increasing
3.  Loop method: Iterations = (n+3) + 2
	Recursion method: Iterations = (2)*(1 - 2^n)/(-1)
4. The loop method is faster as it doesn't require the recalling of itself which makes the virtual machine
	constantly go through conditions and incrementations, then go all the way back returning values.
