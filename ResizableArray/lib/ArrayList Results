Efficiency Tests:
The test took 3557 milliseconds.
And 2560432 bytes of memory.

Your ResizableArray contains the following: 
Footprint{Objects=100002, References=240098, Primitives=[int x 100002]}

PREDICTION:
Run Time: 2300 ms
Memory: 2500000 bytes

TEST RESULT:
The test took 7070 milliseconds.
And 2560432 bytes of memory.

Your ResizableArray contains the following: 
Footprint{Objects=100002, References=240098, Primitives=[int x 100002]}

EXPLANATION:
The arraylist had to constantly move the old values back in order to make space for the new values
causing the program to have a longer run time

PREDICTION #2:
Run Time: 3000 ms
Memory: 2500000 bytes

TEST RESULT:
The test took 15 milliseconds.
And 2560432 bytes of memory.

Your ResizableArray contains the following: 
Footprint{Objects=100002, References=240098, Primitives=[int x 100002]}

EXPLANATION:
Since the arraylist is very large and does not have to move older values, the list was much faster than
the prevous two
